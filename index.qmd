::: [#bio]

I am Chunqing (Tony) Liang, a PhD student in Bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia, working under the supervision of Dr. Amrit Singh. My research focuses on multi-omics data integration, machine learning applications in biology, and the development of reproducible computational workflows for biomedical research.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my B.Sc. in Mathematics with a Minor in Data Science from UBC, where I developed a strong foundation in statistical methods and computational approaches to data analysis.

## Research Interests

My work sits at the intersection of computational biology, machine learning, and statistical inference. I am particularly interested in:

- Multi-omics data integration and systems biology
- Machine learning for biomarker discovery
- Reproducible bioinformatics workflows
- High-dimensional statistical methods
- Translational research in precision medicine

## Background

I am originally from Kaiping, China, but spent most of my formative years in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. This multicultural background has given me a global perspective and the ability to communicate in English, Spanish (*hablo español*), and Mandarin Chinese (当然中文也会一点点).
