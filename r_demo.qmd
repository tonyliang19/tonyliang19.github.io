Here are some examples of R codes:

Calculating mean of a vector of length `n`
```{r calculating-mean}
n <- 10
x <- rnorm(n=n)
print(mean(x))
```

Fitting a simple linear regression model
```{r fitting-lm}
library(tidyverse)

# create dummy data
n <- 25
x1 <- rnorm(n=n, mean=2, sd=3)
x2 <- rnorm(n=n, mean=3, sd=2)
y <- 2*x1 + 3*x2
data <- data.frame(x1 = x1, x2 = x2, y = y)

# fit model and print fitted coefficients
reg <- lm(y ~ . , data=data)
print(reg$coefficients)
```
